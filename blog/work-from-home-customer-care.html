<h2 style="text-align: center">Work From Home (WFH) Customer Care is here to stay.</h2>

<div class="post-meta"><span class="post-meta-date">Dec 25, 2020</span></div>

<p>The pandemic has changed the course of literally every business model and strategy in a very short span of time. While the expectations are always sky-high irrespective of the circumstances, the void created in delivering services due to the shift in processes like customer support has been significant. The challenges have to be addressed swiftly before businesses encounter non-performance and reduced ROI.</p>

<p>Contact support managers need to be on top of their games to elevate the customer experience to match the evolving customer expectations.</p>

<h3>Why Do Call Centers Need Work From Home solutions?</h3>

<p>Customer care forms the backbone of customer engagement irrespective of the prevailing circumstances and hence any disruption in the customer engagement process is not acceptable.</p>

<p>Call centers can leverage WFH solutions to optimize customer experience and support agents at the comfort of their home owing to restricted people movement. These solutions enable customer agents to focus on their work, maintain the quality of service and sustain the customer support process.</p>

<p>In today&rsquo;s diverse working environments being equipped with these solutions is inevitable especially when the new status quo of WFH is not going to change any time soon. According to a report, about 13.4 million people work from home and are still counting.</p>

<h3>Maintaining Business Continuity</h3>

<p>Resilient organizations understand the importance of maintaining customer satisfaction. Not just that, supporting employees is equally important during times of crisis.</p>

<p>For businesses to maintain continuity, a healthy work-life balance of employees, and keep going through the difficult times, tapping into WFH strategies is the ideal way to focus on employee care.</p>

<p>While working from home, WFH solutions help you improve agent engagement, minimize administrative effort, optimize schedule adherence, and reduce costs backed with a modern, cloud solution designed to support even the most extensive contact centers.</p>

<h3>Customer Engagement In a Controlled Environment</h3>

<p>A WFH solution should be comprehensive and not limited to a short-term goal. The traditional solutions are restricted to a generic telephony cloud offering with limited features and functionality along with a mobile app facilitating agents to login and perform after call work.</p>

<p>While the solution proved to be unidirectional and it scored only in handling a temporary goal. The incompleteness was more prominent as the integration with existing CRM or other applications that are relevant to the business process was absent.</p>

<p>Customer engagement in a controlled environment requires a more robust and progressive approach that is future-ready. One option is to deploy a centralized solution within one of the office locations where the secure IT infrastructure is in place and comply with all the data security policies and simultaneously enable the smooth WFH transition allowing users to logging using the enterprise VPN solution or routing the calls to agent mobile numbers in case of bad network quality at the agent location.</p>

<h3>Adapting To The Demand Instantly</h3>

<p>Every business must be ensuring uninterrupted services with workers performing their duties remotely. The present circumstances are indicative of adopting a go-to WFM solution that is able to assist work from home for the long-term. Epicode has been proactive in understanding the rising needs of businesses and adapting to changing times without losing out on the opportunity. The progressive approach is a first step in building a realizable and continuous customer care ecosystem.</p>

<p>In hindsight, the need of the hour for customer agents working from home is an infallible solution to deliver services as usual in the most possible and secure way.<a href="../solutions/epicode-work-from-home.html">For more information click here</a></p>
